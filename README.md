# eCommerce Data Science

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing an eCommerce transactions dataset to perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, build a **Lookalike Model**, and perform **customer segmentation** using clustering techniques. The goal is to derive actionable insights and improve business strategies.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of three files:
1. **Customers.csv**:
   - `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
   - `CustomerName`: Name of the customer.
   - `Region`: Continent where the customer resides.
   - `SignupDate`: Date when the customer signed up.

2. **Products.csv**:
   - `ProductID`: Unique identifier for each product.
   - `ProductName`: Name of the product.
   - `Category`: Product category.
   - `Price`: Product price in USD.

3. **Transactions.csv**:
   - `TransactionID`: Unique identifier for each transaction.
   - `CustomerID`: ID of the customer who made the transaction.
   - `ProductID`: ID of the product sold.
   - `TransactionDate`: Date of the transaction.
   - `Quantity`: Quantity of the product purchased.
   - `TotalValue`: Total value of the transaction.
   - `Price`: Price of the product sold.
